# Chapter 2
“Welcome, brave Seekers! Your quest begins with the first clue. Look for the place where stories dwell. The answer lies within, but it won’t be as easy as it seems. Good luck! ”

They looked at each other with wide eyes. “What does it mean? ” Jake asked, scratching his head. 

“I think it means we should look for a book,” Max suggested thoughtfully. “But where? ”

“Let’s check the children’s section,” Jessica said. “That’s where most stories are! ”

The group hurried inside. Dust floated in the sunlight as they navigated through the rows of shelves. Finally, they reached the children’s section, a cozy area filled with colorful books and a small reading nook. 

Emma spotted an unusual book with a bright red cover. It was hidden behind a row of fairy tales. She took it out and opened it, revealing a hollow space inside. To their surprise, a small key was tucked away inside the book. 

“What do you think this key opens? ” Jake wondered, turning it over in his hands. 

Just then, they noticed a small locked box at the back of the section. Together, they rushed over, and with trembling hands, Emma inserted the key. Click! The box sprang open, revealing a small crystal and the next clue engraved on a piece of parchment. 

“Glimmering light in the dark, leads you to the next mark. Seek where the owl’s wisdom flows, and you’ll find what no one knows. ”

“That must mean the old fountain in the park! ” Jessica exclaimed. They all agreed and raced to the park, their hearts pounding with excitement. 

When they arrived, they spotted the fountain, its water dancing under the sun. But where was the next clue? They searched around it until Max pointed up. “Look! There’s an owl statue on top! ”
